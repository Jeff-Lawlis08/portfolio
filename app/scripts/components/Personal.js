        <p>I am a Junior Front-End Developer who just completed a 12 week immersive course at The Iron Yard. I've always been interested in technology and how things work. I started off as a Computer Science major before deciding to attend The Iron Yard. I'm thrilled to begin a career in something I love to do, and continuing to learn and grow as a developer and as a person.
