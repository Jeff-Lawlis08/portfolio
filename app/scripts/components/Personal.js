        <p>I am a Junior Developer in the process of completing the Coding Boot Camp at the University of Texas. I've always been interested in technology and how things work. I started off as a Computer Science major before deciding to attend the Boot Camp. I am thrilled to begin a career in something I love to do, and continuing to learn and grow as a developer and as a person.
